The problem stemmed from the timing of dynamic content updates.  The solution involved ensuring that Tailwind's post-build processing was triggered *after* the dynamic content was added to the DOM. 

Here's how I resolved the issue:

1. **Using a MutationObserver:**  I added a MutationObserver to watch for changes in the DOM. 
2. **Triggering Tailwind's Post-Process:**  Once the MutationObserver detects changes that indicate dynamic content has loaded, I execute a function to re-initialize or re-apply Tailwind's styling.  For this example we use a placeholder solution of re-rendering an existing element with the class already set.  More advanced solutions might involve using a more advanced re-rendering method, depending on the structure of your application. 

This ensures that Tailwind processes the updated DOM, correctly applying the styles.

This solution requires adjustments based on the specific dynamic content update method and application structure. But the concept of ensuring the DOM is fully updated before Tailwind's post-build process remains consistent.
