# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Styling Failures

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles intermittently fail to apply, even with seemingly correct class usage and post-purge.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is the unpredictable nature of the styling problem.  Sometimes styles render correctly, other times they don't, making debugging difficult.  Standard troubleshooting steps like purging unused styles and verifying Tailwind configuration have not resolved the issue.  The bug seems related to the order in which Javascript loads, specifically involving dynamic content updates.
